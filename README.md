# candy-chat
A private chat extension for Chrome. Users create their unique chat server identifiers, enabling text and file exchanges directly within the browser.

## Concept
This extension utilizes React with TypeScript to build a user-friendly chat app.

1. Users install the extension.
2. They get assigned a unique identifier 'pulpy-orange-9101'.
3. Users set up their names.
4. They then exchange text and files securely with others who have the same extension installed.
5. If another party's network is down, the sender will not be able to send anything.
6. Serverless / Databaseless
